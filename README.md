# NoxEngine
This is here my first project with openGl.

Maybe big feature will come in the futurs. I don't know if its serious project or not.

Help is appreciated


PS : This engine is just my learning experience, you can find the code on youtube, my work here is to transform a render engine from java to c++ with openGl and add my features like NMloader module
